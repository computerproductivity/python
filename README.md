# Learn python with Jupyter notebooks

## Installation

Copy-paste this into a terminal:

```
make notebooks
```

There is a GIT hook that clears all notebooks' binary output (plots and cell results) before commiting your changes to GIT history or you can also clean them with

```
make clean
```

## Getting started

```
make run
```
